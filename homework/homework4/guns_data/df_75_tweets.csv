"@lsdres @NRA And, in summary - if people want to call others terrorists for exercising #GunRights, then that basically speaks for itself.  You lose courtesy at the door when you do that."
@VORPLOCIRAPTOR @Emma4Change That's one of those 'whoopsie!' situations right there.

@SwearengenMaude @angelabiastock @KimLeadford @davidhogg111 No test to own. Just to drive on public roads. I was driving at 11. On the farm.   Of course I humored you. Driving is a privilege not an inalienable right.

"@incredulous_us @josephbenning @piersplatt @RubenGallego Now you're just being daft.  If your ilk would like to remove #2A, there is a process to do that.  Takes 2/3 of both houses, and 75% of states to ratify.  Of course, 44 states have the right to arms in their respective constitutions, so its not looking good for you."

@ibdsh @JoeConchaTV @MEPFuller Nice try. #Hoggwash and his handlers targeted her and advertisers. He was asked why. It wasn't because of her tweet. He doesn't like her politics.   NRA membership way up. Donations to NRA way up. Dems blue wave imploding. Trump near 50%. Thanks Hogg!

@davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle How spineless are you to forcibly put yourself in the public spotlight riding a bullshit narrative but as soon as someone gives you a little shit you have to cry about it?
"@smallvillebuffy @davidhogg111 Of COURSE I would. Duh. NO AMERICAN should hang up on a POTUS. The ONLY culture in the US who would do something so offensive is the SJW perma-offended class. Despicable, classless behavior."

@PamelaMcGraw4DA @BassickDC @BetoORourke @tedcruz Guess not. But I'm very happy.
"@BeatThePress1 @DLoesch The discussion isnt about arming teachers that dont want to be armed, its about those that want to be trained and armed, some already have guns and are trained. Its much better than using their body as a shield. Not to mention its already working in schools. #2A"

@areyou0 Are you sure that's why they're not standing up to Trump? Seems to me it may be more about losing their jobs their pensions and their slings from NRA etc
