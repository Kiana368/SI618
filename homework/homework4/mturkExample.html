      <p>Please read the given comment and label it according to the dimensions described. 
      All the dimensions relate to if/how people reason about their arguments during online political talk.</p>

    <h3>Please label content according to three dimensions</h3>
    <p>You will label content according to three dimensions listed below.</p>
      
    <h4>Dimension 1: Level of Justification</h4>
    <p>For this dimension, we’d like you to indicate if the writer gives any reasons 
        (arguments or evidence) for his/her opinion, and if they make a connection between those 
        reasons and his/her opinion. You can place a comment in one of three categories:<p>
    <ul>
    <li>No justification: The writer only expresses an opinion, 
            but no reasons for that opinion are given.</li>
    <li>Inferior justification: The writer gives a reason (or reasons) to support 
            his/her opinion, but no connection is made between the opinion and the reason.
            (Note: a reason does not need to be evidence based, objective or valid. Any attempt 
            to explain an opinion suffices.)</li>
    <li>Qualified justification:  The writer gives a reason (or reasons) to support 
            their opinion and makes a connection for how that reason supports their opinion. 
            (Note: neither the reason nor the connection need to be evidence-based or valid. 
            Any attempt to provide a reason and make a connection suffices. A “connection” 
            between a reason and an opinion also does not need to be explicit; that is, the writer 
            doesn’t need to say “this reason will to X, because…”, as long as the connection should be 
            fairly obvious to any reader.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dimension 2: Content of justification</h4>
    <p>For this dimension, we would like you to decide if the reason given (if there is one) 
        was one that appeals either only to narrow group interests or to the common good - or to neither.
        Again, there are three possible categories:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>None or neutral: No reasons were given or the reasons did not reference either specific 
            group interests, the common good or common values.</li>
    <li>Reasons related to specific group interests: The reasons given were in terms 
            of benefiting a particular group or aligning with the values of a particular group.</li>
    <li>Reasons related to common good or common values: At least one of the reasons given 
            is framed in terms of helping the common good (that is, everyone will benefit) or 
            being in line with common values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dimension 3: Constructiveness</h4>
    <p>The final dimension concerns consensus building, whether or not the writer made an 
    attempt to find common ground or reach a compromise solution. For this dimension 
    there are two categories:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Positional: The writer is emphatic about his/her opinion. There is no attempt 
        at compromise, reconciliation, or consensus building.</li>
    <li>Constructive: The writer attempts to promote solutions or propositions that 
        might be compromises or move toward agreement.</li>
    </ul>
